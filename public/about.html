<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Tony Rodriguez. I am a 27 year old man who is learning how to program to futher my career. 
  I have always had an intrest in tech and computers. I have done some work with Python and am in the process of learning HTML. 
  I am not sure what path I want to take exactly as it pertains to programming but I am confident this is the right move.</p>

<p>I am also a musician. I was originally a Flute player but quickly learned Saxophone. After graduating High School,
  I decided to take up guitar and bass. I want to eventually learn Drums and Piano. I hope to eventually have a home studio
  and record friends and family. Maybe make some money eventually.</p>

<p>My third love is cars. I love driving just for the sake of driving. I take my convertible on drives to clear my head often. 
  The whole experience is something I really enjoy from the cool breeze to the sound of the engine or the music. I hope to one day
  be able to fund a small collection of fun cars to drive and modify.</p>

<p>Programing is for me is the first step in creating the life that I want to live. I believe that I have finally found something that
  I can effectively do and get good at that leads to the lifestyle I want to live. Between my collection of instruments and desire for 
  fun cars to drive, not to mention the traveling I want to do, Programming gives me the flexibility to do that. I am good at complex issue
  resolution and finding very small minute details that may be the source of something going wrong.</p>

  <p>Thank you for your time.</p>
